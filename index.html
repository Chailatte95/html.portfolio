        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>After receiving my degree in Theology, I moved to New Zealand to work as the Youth Pastor. Since then, I have continued working with children and young people in a variety of settings. I am passioate about people, especially young people, finding their freedom in Christ. Outside of work I love being outdoors, kayaking and walking. Along with this, I also enjoy learning new crafts and skills. I am an enthusiastic and 'bubbly' person who loves to meet new people. </p>
